## Hi there, This is Andy ðŸ‘‹

### I'm a Smart Contract Auditor & Security Researcher @ [Hacken](https://www.hacken.io/)

I am an experienced smart contract security researcher with over 5 years in the blockchain industry, specializing in identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring the security of smart contracts. Most recently, I served as a smart contract auditor at Hacken, where I conducted comprehensive audits, analyzed code for potential exploits, and provided recommendations to improve the projects security. My strong technical background in smart contract development, coupled with my keen eye for detail, allows me to effectively assess risks and identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts. I am passionate about contributing to the safety and reliability of blockchain solutions, helping projects achieve their goals with confidence.
